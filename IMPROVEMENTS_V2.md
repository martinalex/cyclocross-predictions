# VeloPredict v2 Improvements (Post-Tabor)

**Date:** Nov 25, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Flamanville predictions

---

## 🎯 What We Fixed

After Tabor validation showed **90% Top-10 accuracy** but **42% precision** (too many false positives), we implemented three quick wins:

---

## ✅ Quick Win #1: Confidence Threshold

**Problem:** Model predicted 43 Top-10 finishes but only 18 were correct (42% precision)

**Solution:** Increased confidence threshold from 50% → 55%

**Code Change:**
```python
# OLD: predicted_finish = "Top-10" if top10_prob > 0.5 else "Outside Top-10"
# NEW: predicted_finish = "Top-10" if top10_prob > confidence_threshold else "Outside Top-10"
# Default: confidence_threshold = 0.55
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce false positives from ~25 to ~15 per race
- Increase precision from 42% → 60%
- Maintain accuracy at 85-90%

## ✅ Quick Win #2: DNS (Did Not Start) Filter

**Problem:** Tabor predicted Ulík and Groenendaal for podium - both DNS

**Solution:** Flag riders unlikely to start based on:
1. **21+ days since last race** → likely taking break or injured
2. **<2 races this season** → insufficient commitment to season

**Code Change:**
```python
if enable_dns_filter:
    days_since = features.get("days_since_last_race", 7)
    races_count = features.get("races_so_far", 0)

    if days_since > 21:
        dns_risk = True
        dns_reason = f"⚠️ DNS Risk: {days_since} days since last race"
    elif races_count < 2 and status == "found":
        dns_risk = True
        dns_reason = "⚠️ DNS Risk: Only 1 race this season"

# Exclude DNS risks from predictions
predicted_finish = "Top-10" if (top10_prob > threshold and not dns_risk) else "Outside Top-10"
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Filter 2-5 riders per race
- Prevent embarrassing podium predictions for riders who don't start
- Improve podium accuracy from 16.7% → ~50%

## ✅ Quick Win #3: Updated UCI Rankings (Ready When You Provide)

**Problem:** Model trained on older UCI rankings

**Solution:** Use Nov 17, 2025 UCI rankings file

**What Needs To Happen:**
When you provide the updated UCI rankings CSV, we'll update feature extraction to use latest points.

**Expected Impact:**
- More accurate `uci_points_normalized` feature
- Better predictions for riders with recent point changes
- ~2-3% accuracy improvement

## 📊 Expected Performance (Flamanville)

| Metric | Tabor (v1) | Flamanville (v2 Expected) | Change |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Top-10 Accuracy** | 90.0% | 85-90% | Maintain |
| **Precision** | 42% | 60% | **+18%** ✅ |
| **Podium Accuracy** | 16.7% | 40-50% | **+25%** ✅ |
| **Predicted Top-10** | 19-24 riders | 12-15 riders | Realistic |

## 🔧 How To Use

### Default (Recommended):
```bash
python predict_race.py \
  --startlist data/startlists/flamanville_men_elite_2025-11-30.csv \
  --category "Men Elite"
```

Uses:
- ✅ 55% confidence threshold
- ✅ DNS filtering enabled

### Custom Settings:
```python
# In Python:
from predict_race import predict_race

predictions = predict_race(
    startlist_path="data/startlists/flamanville_men_elite.csv",
    category="Men Elite",
    confidence_threshold=0.60,  # More conservative (fewer predictions)
    enable_dns_filter=True       # Keep DNS filtering
)
```

### Disable DNS Filter (for testing):
```bash
# If you want to see what model would predict without DNS filter
# (Will require adding command-line argument)
```

## 🧪 Testing Improvements

To validate these improvements worked, compare:

**Tabor (v1):**
- Predicted: 19 Top-10 (Men Elite)
- Actual: 9 correct
- Precision: 47.4%
- DNS issues: Ulík, Groenendaal predicted for podium (both DNS)

**Flamanville (v2):**
- Predicted: ~12-15 Top-10 (Men Elite) ← Lower count
- Expected: ~9-10 correct ← Same accuracy
- Precision: ~60-70% ← Better precision
- DNS issues: Should flag risky riders ← Prevention

## 🚀 Next Improvements (After Flamanville)

If Flamanville validation shows these quick wins worked, consider:

1. **Podium-Specific Model** (Priority: HIGH if podium still weak)
   - Separate model just for Top-3 prediction
   - Add race-specific features (course type, weather)

2. **Calibrate Probabilities** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Use Platt scaling to calibrate output probabilities
   - Makes 60% mean "actually 60% chance"

3. **Home Advantage Feature** (Priority: LOW)
   - Boost riders from host country
   - Would have helped with Zemanová (Czech rider in Czech race)

4. **Course-Specific Features** (Priority: LOW)
   - Technical vs. power courses
   - Mud conditions
   - Elevation
